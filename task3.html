1. Composition and Making Process:
Ice cream's primary <a href="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qR0__mIa31V0_Rm596V6fwHaJ4&pid=Api&P=0&h=180">ingredients</a> include milk, cream, sugar, and <a href="http://mrtubbs.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/0/3/12037686/1669138_orig.png">flavorings</a>. The mixture is churned to incorporate air, creating a smooth texture and preventing large ice crystals from forming. The process of making ice cream can involve hand-churning or using machines. Stabilizers are sometimes added to maintain texture and consistency​ (Wikipedia)​​ (The Spruce Eats)​.

2. Varieties:

Gelato: This Italian version uses more milk than cream and no eggs, resulting in a denser and richer texture.
Kulfi: A traditional Indian ice cream made by slow-cooking sweetened milk, leading to a denser and creamier texture.
Soft Serve: Popular at fairs and fast-food restaurants, this version is lighter and more airy due to rapid churning​ (PureWow)​.
3. History and Evolution:
Ice cream has a long history dating back to ancient times, but it became widely popular with the advent of refrigeration. Its production and flavors have evolved significantly, offering a variety of options like frozen custard, frozen yogurt, and non-dairy versions made from ingredients like coconut or almond milk​ (Encyclopedia Britannica)​.

4. Storage Tips:
To maintain ice cream's quality, store it in the main compartment of your freezer rather than the door to avoid temperature fluctuations. Cover the surface with plastic wrap before sealing the container to prevent ice crystals from forming​ (The Spruce Eats)​.</p>
